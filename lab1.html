    <h1 class="centered-title">Lab1: The Artemis Board and Bluetooth</h1>
    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <h3>1. Objectives</h3>
    <p>The main goal of this lab is to set up the Arduino IDE and Artemis board.
    The lab also includes using the board LED, reading and writing serial messages, using the
    temperature sensor and Pulse Density Microphone. Besides, it also contains a
    small programming task.</p>
    <h3>2. Prelab</h3>
    <p>First, I need to install Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE can be downloaded <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">here</a></p>
    <h3>3. Instructions</h3>
    <h4>3.1 Connection</h4>
    <p>I hooked the Artemis board up to my computer and followed the <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/artemis-development-with-arduino?_ga=2.30055167.1151850962.1594648676-1889762036.1574524297&_gac=1.19903818.1593457111.Cj0KCQjwoub3BRC6ARIsABGhnyahkG7hU2v-0bSiAeprvZ7c9v0XEKYdVHIIi_-J-m5YLdDBMc2P_goaAtA4EALw_wcB">setup instructions</a>
    to install the Arduino Core for Apollo3. After that, I click "Tools" -> "Board" -> "SparkFun Apollo3 Boards" and choose
    "Redboard Artemis Nano". Then, I click "Tools" -> "Port" and choose "COM3" to select the port.
    In the end, I chose 115200 baud in the Serial Monitor to make sure it returns correct message.</p>
    <h4>3.2 Blink it Up</h4>
    <p>I click "File" -> "Examples" -> "01.Basics" -> "Blink" to load the blink example and
    click "upload" button to run the example. The blink on the Artemis board can be seen in the following video</p>

    </div>
    <h4>3.3 Serial Communication</h4>
    <p>After running the Serial example, you can view the output and provide input through the serial monitor. The output is same as the input.This can be seen in the following video.</p>

    </div>
    <h4>3.4 Analog Read</h4>
    <p>After running the analog read example, I touch the the Artemis board for a while. It can be observed from the following video that the variable "temp(counts)" increase from about 33000 to about 33600. Therefore, the temperature sensor works well.</p>

    </div>
    <h4>3.5 Pulse Density Microphone</h4>
    <p>First, I ran the PDM example. While it is running, I first make some noise to change the highest frequency and then use my mobile phone to produce a steady sound which is 2117 Hz. It can be observed from the following video that the highest frequency keeps unchanged for a few seconds</p>

    </div>
    <h4>Additional tasks for 5000-level students</h4>
    <p>In order to achieve the function described in the instruction, I use the variable "ui32LoudestFrequency" in 3.5 to get the highest frequency first. If it is similar to 440 Hz (musical "A" note), turn on on the LED (that is "digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH)") and turn off otherwise.
    The code and the situation of LED are shown in the following video.</p>

    <h3>4. Discussion</h3>
    <p>From this part, I learnt how to set up the Artemis Board. </p>
